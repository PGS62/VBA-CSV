,"CSVRead","Returns the contents of a comma-separated file on disk as an array.",67,,,,,,,,"`Windows-1252`","[`Windows-1252`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252)"

,"FileName","The full name of the file, including the path, or else a URL of a file, or else a string in CSV format.",103,"The full name of the file, including the path, or else a URL of a file, or else a string in CSV format.",,,,,,,,
,"ConvertTypes","Type conversion: Boolean or string. Allowed letters NDBETQK. N = Numbers, D = Dates, B = Booleans, E = Excel errors, T = trim leading & trailing spaces, Q = quoted fields also converted, K = quotes kept. TRUE = NDB, FALSE = no conversion.",238,"Controls whether fields in the file are converted to typed values or remain as strings, and sets the treatment of ""quoted fields"" and space characters.

ConvertTypes should be a string of zero or more letters from allowed characters `NDBETQK`.

The most commonly useful letters are:
1) `N` number fields are returned as numbers (Doubles).
2) `D` date fields (that respect DateFormat) are returned as Dates.
3) `B` fields matching TrueStrings or FalseStrings are returned as Booleans.

ConvertTypes is optional and defaults to the null string for no type conversion. `TRUE` is equivalent to `NDB` and `FALSE` to the null string.

Four further options are available:
4) `E` fields that match Excel errors are converted to error values. There are fourteen of these, including `#N/A`, `#NAME?`, `#VALUE!` and `#DIV/0!`.
5) `T` leading and trailing spaces are trimmed from fields. In the case of quoted fields, this will not remove spaces between the quotes.
6) `Q` conversion happens for both quoted and unquoted fields; otherwise only unquoted fields are converted.
7) `K` quoted fields are returned with their quotes kept in place.

For most files, correct type conversion can be achieved with ConvertTypes as a string which applies for all columns, but type conversion can also be specified on a per-column basis.

Enter an array (or range) with two columns or two rows, column numbers on the left/top and type conversion (subset of `NDBETQK`) on the right/bottom. Instead of column numbers, you can enter strings matching the contents of the header row, and a column number of zero applies to all columns not otherwise referenced.

For convenience when calling from VBA, you can pass an array of two element arrays such as `Array(Array(0,""N""),Array(3,""""),Array(""Phone"",""""))` to convert all numbers in a file into numbers in the return except for those in column 3 and in the column(s) headed ""Phone"".",,,,,,,,
,"Delimiter","Delimiter string. Defaults to the first instance of comma, tab, semi-colon, colon or pipe found outside quoted regions within the first 10,000 characters. Enter FALSE to  see the file's contents as would be displayed in a text editor.",234,"By default, CSVRead will try to detect a file's delimiter as the first instance of comma, tab, semi-colon, colon or pipe found in the first 10,000 characters of the file, searching only outside of quoted regions and outside of date-with-time fields (since these contain colons). If it can't auto-detect the delimiter, it will assume comma. If your file includes a different character or string delimiter you should pass that as the Delimiter argument.

Alternatively, enter `FALSE` as the delimiter to treat the file as ""not a delimited file"". In this case the return will mimic how the file would appear in a text editor such as NotePad. The file will be split into lines at all line breaks (irrespective of double quotes) and each element of the return will be a line of the file.",,,,,,,,
,"IgnoreRepeated","Whether delimiters which appear at the start of a line, the end of a line or immediately after another delimiter should be ignored while parsing; useful for fixed-width files with delimiter padding between fields.",213,"Whether delimiters which appear at the start of a line, the end of a line or immediately after another delimiter should be ignored while parsing; useful for fixed-width files with delimiter padding between fields.",,,,,,,,

,"ExtraHelp","See also companion function CSVWrite.

The function handles all csv files that conform to the standards described in RFC4180  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt including files with quoted fields.

In addition the function handles files which break some of those standards:
* Not all lines of the file need have the same number of fields. The function ""pads"" with ShowMissingsAs values.
* Fields which start with a double quote but do not end with a double quote are handled by being returned unchanged. Necessarily such fields have an even number of double quotes, or otherwise the field will be treated as the last field in the file.
* The standard states that csv files should have Windows-style line endings, but the function supports files with Windows, Unix and (old) Mac line endings. Files may also have mixed line endings.",,,,,,,,,,
