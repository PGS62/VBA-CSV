219	06-Feb-2023	15:43	Philip Swannell	SkipToCol and NumCols arguments to CSVRead can now be provided as strings that match into the header row.
218	04-Jan-2023	16:21	Philip Swannell	Recorded performance of CSVWrite.
217	04-Jan-2023	16:20	Philip Swannell	Method MakeEncoder is now Private - avoids exposing as a worksheet function.
216	29-Nov-2022	14:40	Philip Swannell	Whitespace only.
215	29-Nov-2022	14:29	Philip Swannell	Bumped to v0.26
214	28-Nov-2022	14:25	Philip Swannell	Updated ToDo list.
213	28-Nov-2022	13:45	Philip Swannell	Recorded performance of CSVWrite. Edits to rubric at top of modCSVReadWrite.
212	28-Nov-2022	12:29	Philip Swannell	Added error handlers to a couple of methods.
211	28-Nov-2022	09:49	Philip Swannell	Bumped to v0.25
210	28-Nov-2022	09:37	Philip Swannell	Refactored CSVWrite.
209	27-Nov-2022	16:13	Philip Swannell	Changes in release 208 seem to have more than doubled the speed for CSVWrite for large files. Average time to execute CSVWrite(Data, FileName) when Data is obtained from RDataSets file military.csv (1.4 million rows, 7 cols) falls from 24 seconds to 11 seconds.
208	27-Nov-2022	15:39	Philip Swannell	Changes to CSVWrite, with hope of improved performance, but not yet tested.
207	27-Nov-2022	15:22	Philip Swannell	Added module modCSVWritePerformance, in order to benchmark changes to CSVWrite.
206	26-Nov-2022	18:17	Philip Swannell	Spell-checked this Audit sheet.
205	26-Nov-2022	17:58	Philip Swannell	Simplified method Encode, which now uses a dictionary to handle encoding of Booleans and errors.
204	24-Nov-2022	14:05	Philip Swannell	Bumped to v0.24
203	24-Nov-2022	13:49	Philip Swannell	Changed CSVWrite so that when called on PC for which the display language of VBA is not English, then errors are written to file using the English-language representation (e.g. #SPILL!). This makes round-tripping work correctly.
202	18-Nov-2022	12:22	Philip Swannell	Further changes to ReThrow. Error strings from CSVRead and CSVWrite are now concise unless m_ErrorStringsEmbedCallStack is set to True.
201	18-Nov-2022	11:13	Philip Swannell	Change to expected results for tests to soft code the string representation of True and False, so that tests pass on non English language PCs.
200	18-Nov-2022	10:27	Philip Swannell	a) Removed module modCodeFromStackOverflow.<LF>b) Simplified methods Throw and ReThrow, as a consequence error string now include the "call stack".<LF>c) Changes to tests such that if observed and expected are both error strings that differ but have the same "root cause" then the test passes but with a warning printed to the VBA immediate window.<LF>d) Removed declared-but-unused variables (via MZTools).<LF>e) Changes to round trip testing to pass in TrueStrings and FalseStrings such that tests should work on non English-language PC.
199	17-Nov-2022	18:33	Philip Swannell	Added Test254 for a file containing only two characters - a carriage return and a line feed, but test currently fails - need to investigate.
198	17-Nov-2022	18:15	Philip Swannell	Change to (hopefully) fix bug on non English-language version of Excel. Passing ConvertTypes as True failed on PC with display language of German. Not yet tested though.
197	09-Nov-2022	22:43	Philip Swannell	Code comments only.
196	09-Nov-2022	18:32	Philip Swannell	Bumped to v0.23
195	09-Nov-2022	18:21	Philip Swannell	Early bind to ADODB. Will require change to installation instructions.
194	09-Nov-2022	18:00	Philip Swannell	Changes on sheet CSVWriteTests.
193	09-Nov-2022	17:56	Philip Swannell	Bumped to v0.22
192	09-Nov-2022	17:52	Philip Swannell	Code comments only.
191	09-Nov-2022	17:07	Philip Swannell	Ran a new set of performance tests. See sheet 'Performance (10)'.
190	09-Nov-2022	15:18	Philip Swannell	Re-ordered methods in modCSVReadWrite.
189	09-Nov-2022	14:49	Philip Swannell	Added line numbers to modCSVReadWrite. These will appear in the call stack only for unanticipated errors, i.e. the kind we need to debug.
188	09-Nov-2022	14:22	Philip Swannell	Reformed error handling in all the modules.
187	09-Nov-2022	10:25	Philip Swannell	Reformed error handling. Error handlers in all methods are now simpler just calling new method ReThrow. We now no longer see the "call stack" in the return from CSVRead if the error is "anticipated" (mostly input validation) but we do see the call stack for unanticipated errors.
186	08-Nov-2022	19:43	Philip Swannell	Ensure streams are always closed.
185	08-Nov-2022	19:29	Philip Swannell	CSVRead now always uses ADODB text stream (rather than ADODB for some encodings and Scripting.TextStream for other encodings). Refactored and simplified.
184	08-Nov-2022	16:12	Philip Swannell	Removed Stop statement.
183	08-Nov-2022	15:54	Philip Swannell	Added timer functions tic and toc.
182	08-Nov-2022	15:07	Philip Swannell	Optimised ReadAllFromStream - ChunkSize now set to 32,768.
181	07-Nov-2022	19:48	Philip Swannell	Charset is now "windows-1252" for ANSI files.
180	07-Nov-2022	16:36	Philip Swannell	Ran MZTools -> Clean Project.
179	07-Nov-2022	11:03	Philip Swannell	Refactored recent changes to modCSVReadWrite.
178	07-Nov-2022	10:10	Philip Swannell	Removed worksheet UnicodeTests, have replaced by tests 249 to 252.
177	06-Nov-2022	18:21	Philip Swannell	Changes to method ReadAllFromStream - should give a performance improvement, but need to test whether that is the case.
176	06-Nov-2022	11:07	Philip Swannell	Added worksheet UnicodeTests
175	06-Nov-2022	09:09	Philip Swannell	Refactored method ParseEncoding. Previously there were two places in the code where we decided whether to use a TextStream or ADODB (according to whether the Encoding argument had been provided or had to be guessed\inferred), now only one place.
174	06-Nov-2022	08:23	Philip Swannell	Reverted the 4 class modules (garcia code) to as they were in version 145. They had since been amended by MZTools\my AmendVBA code. Did so because my function wrap_ws_garcia has stopped working...
173	05-Nov-2022	09:09	Philip Swannell	Tweak to method ReadAllFromStream.
172	04-Nov-2022	19:37	Philip Swannell	Improved validation of argument ShowMissingsAs.
171	04-Nov-2022	17:18	Philip Swannell	Added tests for CSVWrite. modCSVWrite now uses consts DQ and DQ2 throughout.
170	03-Nov-2022	19:29	Philip Swannell	Bumped version to v0.20
169	03-Nov-2022	18:59	Philip Swannell	Removed breakpoint, removed declared but unused variables.
168	03-Nov-2022	18:25	Philip Swannell	Method InferDelimiter could fail for UTF-8 and UTF-16 files (the BOM was being read as part of the file's contents). Fixed this.
167	03-Nov-2022	16:43	Philip Swannell	Improved method InferDelimiter to avoid interpreting the colon inside a date-with-time field as the file delimiter.
166	03-Nov-2022	14:33	Philip Swannell	Round trip tests extended to test various DateTimeFormats. Amended CSVWrite to recognise "ISO" as a DateFormat (was confusing for that to be recognised as DateTimeFormat but not as DateFormat).
165	03-Nov-2022	13:04	Philip Swannell	More testing of CSVWrite - important to test aspects of CSVWrite that are not tested in the round-trip tests, e.g. invalid inputs and behaviour when returning to worksheet and when QuoteAllStrings is FALSE.
164	03-Nov-2022	09:40	Philip Swannell	Help changes
163	02-Nov-2022	19:24	Philip Swannell	Help changes
162	02-Nov-2022	19:05	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite was not correctly handling argument QuoteAllStrings when the delimiter was not a comma. CSVRead fix to another edge case re ragged files and ShowMissingsAs.
161	01-Nov-2022	17:05	Philip Swannell	CSVRead: Now reject elements of TrueStrings, FalseStrings and MissingStrings that are not valid fields of a CSV file. Added tests 209 to 232 (to increase code coverage). Use & instead of + for string concatenation. Fixed edge case in CSVRead with regards to missing fields in ragged files.
160	31-Oct-2022	16:43	Philip Swannell	Code comments about intellisense.
159	28-Oct-2022	14:27	Philip Swannell	Removed commented-out module modCSVDevUtils. Tweak to method ValidateBooleanRepresentation. Amended variable declaration (automatically, via a script).
158	25-Oct-2022	18:18	Philip Swannell	Tweaks to CSVWrite including changed behaviour if DateFormat is passed as null string (as opposed to being omitted). Old behaviour: date format used in output would depend on the Windows locale. New behaviour: date format used is YYYY-MM-DD, i.e. same as omitting the argument.
157	24-Oct-2022	09:39	Philip Swannell	CSVRead: better handling for when Booleans in file are represented by quoted strings. E.g. https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/TitanicSurvival.csv where the TrueString is quoted yes and FalseString is quoted no.
156	24-Oct-2022	09:22	Philip Swannell	Method ValidateTrueAndFalseStrings now rejects strings containing line feed, carriage return, delimiter (cont.)
155	24-Oct-2022	09:03	Philip Swannell	Method ValidateTrueAndFalseStrings now rejects strings containing line feed, carriage return, delimiter.
154	23-Oct-2022	16:32	Philip Swannell	Tweaked method ValidateTrueAndFalseStrings. Removed worksheet Adhoc.
153	23-Oct-2022	15:52	Philip Swannell	Fixed compile error. Added test 207.
152	23-Oct-2022	12:24	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite, improved validation of TrueString and FalseString. Added one more test for CSVRead.
151	22-Oct-2022	18:16	Philip Swannell	Improved handling of files containing long fields - length of field is now tested after "unquoting".
150	22-Oct-2022	17:39	Philip Swannell	Now know that for Excel 2013 function MaxStringLengthInArray should return 255. Also changes to code that detects that an array to be returned to Excel contains a too-long string.
149	22-Oct-2022	10:17	Philip Swannell	Tested on Excel 2010, with necessary changes to test code.
148	21-Oct-2022	16:41	Philip Swannell	Bumped tag to 16.
147	21-Oct-2022	16:39	Philip Swannell	Added arguments TrueString and FalseString to CSVWrite.
146	21-Oct-2022	16:16	Philip Swannell	1) Bug fix to method ParseCSVContents for case ConvertTypes <> FALSE _and_ SkipToRow > 1 _and_ HeaderRow > 1 _and_ SkipToRow = HeaderRow. Test = 203<LF>2) Argument DateFormat can now use the space character as the separator. e.g. "D M Y" is allowed. Test = 204.
145	01-Nov-2021	16:18	Philip Swannell	Now use SolumAddin for exporting VBA code.
144	01-Nov-2021	16:06	Philip Swannell	Vba code is now exported to folder c:\Projects\<ProjectName>\vba\<WorkbookName>
143	14-Oct-2021	17:09	Philip Swannell	Moved performance testing methods out of modCSVReadWrite. 331 fewer loc.
142	14-Oct-2021	16:36	Philip Swannell	In release 120 (or soon after) I followed suggestions from RubberDuck code analysis to explicitly declare all arguments as ByVal or ByRef with preference for ByVal. But I now believe that caused a performance hit, especially when ConvertTypes is not FALSE. Reverted declarations to as of version 119. I now declare as follows:<LF>ByVal = argument will be changed in function and we don't want that change to be visible to the caller.<LF>ByRef = argument will be changed in function and we DO want that change to be visible to the caller.<LF>Silent = argument won't be changed in the function, so pass by reference (the default) for better speed.
141	14-Oct-2021	09:42	Philip Swannell	Added to ToDo list.
140	14-Oct-2021	09:26	Philip Swannell	Comments in module modCSVTestRDatasets.
139	13-Oct-2021	17:17	Philip Swannell	Reinstated changes that were lost in 138.
138	13-Oct-2021	17:14	Philip Swannell	Reverted to 137 as 138 corrupted.
137	12-Oct-2021	12:37	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite now accepts one-dimensional Data.
136	11-Oct-2021	19:11	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite now accepts zero-dimensional Data.
135	08-Oct-2021	19:29	Philip Swannell	More performance testing
134	08-Oct-2021	16:24	Philip Swannell	Tweaked method PrepareForRelease.
133	08-Oct-2021	11:41	Philip Swannell	Improved error handling in method Download.
132	08-Oct-2021	10:55	Philip Swannell	Method TimeParsers now adjusts for the overhead of calling ElapsedTime within the timing loop.
131	07-Oct-2021	22:33	Philip Swannell	Removed line numbers.
130	05-Oct-2021	16:25	Philip Swannell	Added another VBA CSV parser to those tested by Performance-testing code. It's the top-voted answer on the most relevant StackOverflow question (at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12259595/load-csv-file-into-a-vba-array-rather-than-excel-sheet?)
129	04-Oct-2021	10:06	Philip Swannell	Work on non-RFC4180
128	01-Oct-2021	10:27	Philip Swannell	Added sheet NotRFC4180.
127	30-Sep-2021	15:54	Philip Swannell	Re-ran performance tests. Strangely there seems to have been a regression in Julia's performance...
126	30-Sep-2021	14:27	Philip Swannell	Changes prompted by RubberDuck analysis.
125	30-Sep-2021	13:47	Philip Swannell	Changes prompted by RubberDuck analysis.

123	30-Sep-2021	08:28	Philip Swannell	Re-imported ws_garcia code - I must have inadvertently changed it when making the Rubberduck-prompted changes and somehow broke it.
122	29-Sep-2021	19:38	Philip Swannell	Changes prompted by RubberDuck analysis.
121	29-Sep-2021	18:17	Philip Swannell	Changes prompted by RubberDuck analysis.
120	29-Sep-2021	16:59	Philip Swannell	Changes prompted by RubberDuck analysis.
119	29-Sep-2021	12:42	Philip Swannell	First GIF revisited.

106	24-Sep-2021	12:46	Philip Swannell	Sorted methods in module modCSVReadWrite
105	24-Sep-2021	10:56	Philip Swannell	Work on 32k/255 limit for returning strings to Excel
104	23-Sep-2021	14:01	Philip Swannell	Late bind to ADODB. It would make installation simpler if late bound to Scripting run time and regular expressions but that I suspect that would hit performance.
103	23-Sep-2021	13:13	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite now takes argument Encoding rather than Unicode.
102	23-Sep-2021	10:05	Philip Swannell	Added to TODO list.
101	22-Sep-2021	11:58	Philip Swannell	Deleted older of the two Performance sheets.
100	22-Sep-2021	11:56	Philip Swannell	Added tests for date-time parsing, including decimal fractions of a second for D-M-Y, M-D-Y and Y-M-D.
99	21-Sep-2021	17:39	Philip Swannell	Reduced the number of lines> 122 in length
98	21-Sep-2021	16:07	Philip Swannell	Simplified declaration of CSVRead by not providing unnecessary defaults.
97	21-Sep-2021	15:59	Philip Swannell	More tests using files from the Julia CSV.jl test suite.
96	21-Sep-2021	15:24	Philip Swannell	Fixed bug that SkipToRow was not defaulting to HeaderRowNum+1 when omitted.
95	21-Sep-2021	14:45	Philip Swannell	Corrected typos on worksheet "Test".
94	21-Sep-2021	14:15	Philip Swannell	Method ParseTextFile replaces methods ShowTextFile and SplitCSVContents. Better performance when Delimited = False.
93	20-Sep-2021	17:56	Philip Swannell	Docstring changes.
92	20-Sep-2021	17:11	Philip Swannell	Rewrote ShowTextFile to work for files with Mac line endings.

88	20-Sep-2021	10:21	Philip Swannell	Changes on Test sheet.
87	20-Sep-2021	09:43	Philip Swannell	Added five more tests to be sure we interpret ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-8-BOM, UTF-16-LE-BOM and UTF-16-BE-BOM correctly.
86	19-Sep-2021	19:14	Philip Swannell	Now use ADODB.Stream for UTF-8 files and Scripting.Stream for ASCII, ANSI and UTF-16.
85	19-Sep-2021	18:31	Philip Swannell	ReadTextWrapper mostly solves the performance problem.
84	19-Sep-2021	16:33	Philip Swannell	Performance turned out to be terrible thanks to bad performance of ADODB.ReadText on large files. Wrote method ReadTextWrapper to (hopefully) solve the problem.
83	19-Sep-2021	11:16	Philip Swannell	All tests pass with ADODB.Stream, need to check performance.
82	19-Sep-2021	10:16	Philip Swannell	Experimenting with using ADODB.Stream in place of Scripting.TextStream
81	11-Sep-2021	11:30	Philip Swannell	Code comments only.
80	11-Sep-2021	09:42	Philip Swannell	Added test for FileName being literal with no line feed.

58	31-Aug-2021	09:52	Philip Swannell	Workbook now more "portable" i.e. folder locations all relative to the path of the workbook itself.
57	30-Aug-2021	19:35	Philip Swannell	Reinstated conditional formatting on sheet Demo.
56	30-Aug-2021	18:30	Philip Swannell	Deal with times with fractional seconds - CDate does not cope with them.

49	26-Aug-2021	18:29	Philip Swannell	Refactoring
48	26-Aug-2021	13:47	Philip Swannell	Got rid of RetainQuotes option for ConvertTypes. ConvertTypes TRUE is now NDB rather than NDBE as previously.
47	26-Aug-2021	13:44	Philip Swannell	Now have two possibilities for DateFormat: ISO and ISOZ, the latter handles datetime with time zone.
46	25-Aug-2021	00:15	Philip Swannell	Added more tests.
45	24-Aug-2021	19:41	Philip Swannell	Added sheet "RegExp".
