154	23-Oct-2022	16:32	Philip Swannell	Tweaked method ValidateTrueAndFalseStrings. Removed worksheet Adhoc.
153	23-Oct-2022	15:52	Philip Swannell	Fixed compile error. Added test 207.
152	23-Oct-2022	12:24	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite, improved validation of TrueString and FalseString. Added one more test for CSVRead.
151	22-Oct-2022	18:16	Philip Swannell	Improved handling of files containing long fields - length of field is now tested after "unquoting".
150	22-Oct-2022	17:39	Philip Swannell	Now know that for Excel 2013 function MaxStringLengthInArray should return 255. Also changes to code that detects that an array to be returned to Excel contains a too-long string.
149	22-Oct-2022	10:17	Philip Swannell	Tested on Excel 2010, with necessary changes to test code.
148	21-Oct-2022	16:41	Philip Swannell	Bumped tag to 16.
147	21-Oct-2022	16:39	Philip Swannell	Added arguments TrueString and FalseString to CSVWrite.
146	21-Oct-2022	16:16	Philip Swannell	1) Bug fix to method ParseCSVContents for case ConvertTypes <> FALSE _and_ SkipToRow > 1 _and_ HeaderRow > 1 _and_ SkipToRow = HeaderRow. Test = 203<LF>2) Argument DateFormat can now use the space character as the deparator. e.g. "D M Y" is allowed. Test = 204.
145	01-Nov-2021	16:18	Philip Swannell	Now use SolumAddin for exporting VBA code.
144	01-Nov-2021	16:06	Philip Swannell	Vba code is now exported to folder c:\Projects\<ProjectName>\vba\<WorkbookName>
143	14-Oct-2021	17:09	Philip Swannell	Moved performance testing methods out of modCSVReadWrite. 331 fewer loc.
142	14-Oct-2021	16:36	Philip Swannell	In release 120 (or soon after) I followed suggestions from RubberDuck code analysis to explicitly declare all arguments as ByVal or ByRef with preference for ByVal. But I now believe that caused a performance hit, especially when ConvertTypes is not FALSE. Reverted declarations to as of version 119. I now declare as follows:<LF>ByVal = argument will be changed in function and we don't want that change to be visible to the caller.<LF>ByRef = argument will be changed in function and we DO want that change to be visible to the caller.<LF>Silent = argument won't be changed in the function, so pass by reference (the default) for better speed.
141	14-Oct-2021	09:42	Philip Swannell	Added to ToDo list.

138	13-Oct-2021	17:14	Philip Swannell	Reverted to 137 as 138 corrupted.
137	12-Oct-2021	12:37	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite now accepts one-dimensional Data.
136	11-Oct-2021	19:11	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite now accepts zero-dimensional Data.
135	08-Oct-2021	19:29	Philip Swannell	More performance testing
134	08-Oct-2021	16:24	Philip Swannell	Tweaked method PrepareForRelease.

132	08-Oct-2021	10:55	Philip Swannell	Method TimeParsers now adjusts for the overhead of calling ElapsedTime within the timing loop.

130	05-Oct-2021	16:25	Philip Swannell	Added another VBA CSV parser to those tested by Performance-testing code. It's the top-voted answer on the most relevant StackOverflow question (at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12259595/load-csv-file-into-a-vba-array-rather-than-excel-sheet?)
129	04-Oct-2021	10:06	Philip Swannell	Work on non-RFC4180
128	01-Oct-2021	10:27	Philip Swannell	Added sheet NotRFC4180.
127	30-Sep-2021	15:54	Philip Swannell	Re-ran performance tests. Strangely there seems to have been a regression in Julia's performance...

123	30-Sep-2021	08:28	Philip Swannell	Re-imported ws_garcia code - I must have inadvertantly changed it when making the Rubberduck-prompted changes and somehow broke it.
122	29-Sep-2021	19:38	Philip Swannell	Changes prompted by RubberDuck analysis.
121	29-Sep-2021	18:17	Philip Swannell	Changes prompted by RubberDuck analysis.

104	23-Sep-2021	14:01	Philip Swannell	Late bind to ADODB. It would make installation simpler if late bound to Scripting run time and regular expressions but that I suspect that would hit performance.
103	23-Sep-2021	13:13	Philip Swannell	CSVWrite now takes argument Encoding rather than Unicode.
102	23-Sep-2021	10:05	Philip Swannell	Added to TODO list.

95	21-Sep-2021	14:45	Philip Swannell	Corrected typos on worksheet "Test".
94	21-Sep-2021	14:15	Philip Swannell	Method ParseTextFile replaces methods ShowTextFile and SplitCSVContents. Better performance when Delimited = False.

87	20-Sep-2021	09:43	Philip Swannell	Added five more tests to be sure we interpret ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-8-BOM, UTF-16-LE-BOM and UTF-16-BE-BOM correctly.
86	19-Sep-2021	19:14	Philip Swannell	Now use ADODB.Stream for UTF-8 files and Scripting.Stream for ASCII, ANSI and UTF-16.
85	19-Sep-2021	18:31	Philip Swannell	ReadTextWrapper mostly solves the performance problem.
84	19-Sep-2021	16:33	Philip Swannell	Performance turned out to be terrible thanks to bad perfromance of ADODB.ReadText on large files. Wrote method ReadTextWrapper to (hopefully) solve the problem.
83	19-Sep-2021	11:16	Philip Swannell	All tests pass with ADODB.Stream, need to check performance.
82	19-Sep-2021	10:16	Philip Swannell	Experimenting with using ADODB.Stream in place of Scripting.TextStream
